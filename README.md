**Malware Detection Project**

**Overview:**

This project is aimed at developing a malware detection system using machine learning and data analysis techniques. The system is designed to identify malicious software (malware) from legitimate software (benign) based on features extracted from executable files.

**Usage:**

Data Preparation: You need to obtain a dataset of both benign and malware samples. Place these files in the data directory.

Feature Extraction: Use the provided scripts in the feature_extraction directory to extract relevant features from the executable files.

Training the Model: Train a machine learning model using the features and labels from the dataset. The models directory contains example scripts for model training and evaluation.

Prediction: You can use the trained model for malware detection on new files. Use the provided prediction scripts in the predict directory.
